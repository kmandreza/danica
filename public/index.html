		<p>Welcome loved ones to our wedding website!  We hope this site will be a useful tool for you to access all things Sanchis wedding related.</p>  
		<p>Our goal is to keep this site as up-to-date as possible, so please do visit often as we will continue to add pertinent details leading up to the big day - September 28th, 2012!</p>
		<p>Please note, that September is still peak season in the Santa Cruz area, so we recommend you book your travel and hotel accommodations as soon as possible.  You can find information related to our hotel block as well as other suggestions for hotels in the area under the accommodations tab.  We have also provided travel suggestions for those guests flying in from out of town.  Thank you all in advance for making the trip!!! </p>
		<p>Our hotel block is located just down the hill from our wedding venue - the Kennolyn Hilltop Hacienda, located in Soquel just behind Capitola in the Santa Cruz Mountains.  Since we want to be sure our guests have a safe and wonderful time, we will be providing transportation to and from the wedding venue from the hotel block, so please keep that in mind as you are booking your accommodations but feel free to stay where you please.</p>
<p>With that said enjoy the site!  We thank you very much for your love and support. We hope to see each and every one of you on our big day but look forward to celebrating with you all for a lifetime...</p>

<p>See you in September!</p>
<p>Danica &amp; Joe</p>
